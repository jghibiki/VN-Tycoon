    "I am [programmer_name], and I'm a programmer, and today I stop putting off work and start work on programming a Visual Novel. I tend to get easily distracted and procrastinate without my daily meds...and if I don't finish something by the end of this month, I might not have enough money to buy more medication. I NEED to do this! I WILL do this!"
    "My mom says I probably won't be successful with this, and she'll have to pay for more meds if I fail... but I want to prove that I can succeed this way, and make a living for myself. Meds and all."
