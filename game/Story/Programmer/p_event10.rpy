    #after hiring a musician

    t "After I almost went deaf trying to listen to the playbacks of my vocal adventures, I broke down and went hunting for a musician. I didn't know where to look, so I started at my usual Lemming recruitment."
    t "I was a bit leery when I accepted his offer, but it wasn't like I had any better choice at the time. I was running out of the nice glasses to my shattering voice."
    t "When he told me that he was trying to make music for visual novels so because he was tired of doing souless tunes, I was surprised. I had to ask if he had a heart condition as well, but it turns out that we aren't the same that much."
    t "I wonder how many other people on this forum are also dreamers like me. How many other people dream of making it big in these new frontiers and making a name for themselves?"
    t "There are several cases of people already being able to do it. One of the forum goers who serves as a mentor to me showed me his download numbers, and they are astounding."
    t "Could I reach out like that? Could some young ill programmer reach out to the masses and tell them a story they'll share with their friends? Could I really make a living out of this?"
    t "I want to talk more with the music man, but I also don't want to drown him in philosophical debates. I think I will just keep them to myself."
    t "Someday... someday people will want to hear my musings..."
