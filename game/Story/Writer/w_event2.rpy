    Joan "Ugh. Just staring at this .doc makes me suicidal. How did I not get past 2,000 words after eight days? I said I was a writer, dammit, so why am I not writing? This is a cardinal rule of the damn universe: An artist makes art, a programmer programs, composers compose and writers... write, dammit!"
    Joan "Bah, it's just not coming to me. Screw it, I give up. This isn't working out. They say to 'just write', but how the hell am I supposed to 'just write' if I can't figure out where to even start? Like, whoever thought of the entire 'just write': I want to punch you in the balls."
    Joan "I'm not even joking. I will find out where you live. I will come down to your house and punch you in the friggin' balls. And then punch your wife in the tits. And your dog on the snout."
    Joan "Wait, scratch that, the poor dog's done nothing wrong. I can't punch an innocent bystander, that'd be inhumane."
    Joan "But I'll still punch YOU, your wife, and probably your children too; they deserve it. Or will deserve it. I'm pretty sure there's not a kid in the world that hasn't deserved a beating at some point. Multiple points."
    Joan "Wait, that's it! Brilliant! Way to go, Joan. That's how we'll proceed from here. Hahaha! I'm a genius. God, quick, I have to write this down."
    Joan "... And it's gone."
    Joan "GOD. DAMMIT."
