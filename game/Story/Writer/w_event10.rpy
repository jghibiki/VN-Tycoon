    Joan neutral "Awright! I got one! A programmer, at that. Finally. I mean, I could probably figure out all of this myself, but that'd take too long anyway. It's fine if I hire someone, right?"
    Joan neutral "This pay is outrageous, though. What's he need it for anyway? Izzit really all for medicine? What's he running, a pharmacy?"
    Joan neutral "Well, I guess it doesn't matter. I mean, I can afford him. Probably. Maybe. I think. Man, if you weren't all sadface on me I wouldn't have bothered. You're lucky I'm so generous."
    Joan neutral "And stupid. I need to see if I can work double shifts somewhere. Or maybe hit up that site again for the work."
    Joan neutral "Yeah, this'll work out. No problem. I've got a programmer, he's ace, I'm ace, we're all ace. This is gonna be just fine, Joan! It'll be fine!"
    Joan neutral "... I'm so doomed."
