    #Event 8: Conditions: Day 10
    Martha "My procastination kept continuing, things just seemed impossible."
    Martha "But I wanted to do stuff, but when I tried I'd think about how behind I was and that would make me stop. I was stuck in an endless loop of doing nothing!"
    Martha "I let out a sigh as I once again put down my drawing pen. I couldn't seem to get anywhere. If it wasn't the feeling that something was off, it was being distracted by my mother or something else, there just seemed no motivation to draw anymore..."
    Martha "What was I going to do...?"
    Martha "If I couldn't find any motivation to draw I was never going to complete a visual novel. I was going to be stuck following my mother like a little lost puppy for my whole life. And yet... that didn't cause me to want draw even... I was blocked, completely and utterly stuck."
    Martha "I needed help..."
    Martha "I found myself once again procrastinating and just lazing around on the internet and social media."
    Martha "And then I saw it."
    Martha "A private message from someone at Lemmming Soft."
    Martha "They were asking how I was doing. Someone... was worried about me."
    Martha "It was a strange feeling. One I don't think I've ever experienced before."
    Martha "It made me feel all warm inside."
    Martha "I read the message, I don't know how many times. Each time my happiness kept coming back more and more, and I felt slightly motivated."
    Martha "I typed up a response and sent it off."
    Martha "I finally had a renewed vigor."
