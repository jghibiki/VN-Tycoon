    #Event 9: Conditions: Day 13
    Martha happy "Something strange had happened. I had made a good friend over the internet. One that I'd think about how he'd respond throughout the whole day."
    Martha "I go through my day anxious to hear his reply. I'd check to see if he replied every few minutes."
    Martha "And each time we replied back and forth between each other a smile would beam on my face. After a while we decided that Lemming Soft's private messaging was just not good enough, and we shared instant messaging addresses."
    Martha "He gave me hope. He renwed my spirit each time we talked. I felt good about myself for the first time in my life. When we talked I never wanted it to end."
    Martha sad "I think something is wrong with me."
    Martha happy "But still I loved it."
    Martha happy_blush "I was obessed."
    Martha "I didn't want it to end."
    Martha "I... I...."
    Martha happy "I feel like drawing again."
