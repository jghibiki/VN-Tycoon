    #Event 11: Conditions: Day 19
    Martha happy "It became a daily thing. I'd talk to my Lemming Soft buddy over FingerHurt and tell him my troubles."
    Martha "It honestly began so necessary and routine that I don't know if I could live without him."
    Martha "He meant that much to me."
    Marthas "I'd like to see your art sometime."
    Martha happy_blush "I read aloud the words on the screen. The words that caused my body to shake."
    Martha sad "My art... it wasn't... any good..."
    Martha "There was something missing.... I never showed it to anymore because it wasn't good... I needed something. No matter what I drew... I felt the same way."
    Martha "It is missing something."
    Martha "This isn't good. Something is off."
    Martha "Every time it would feel that way."
    Martha "I took a deep breath and tried to calm myself down."
    Marthas annoyed "I can't show my art to anyone."
    Marthas "I just can't...."
    Marthas "Please... understand..."
    Martha sad "I'm too afraid...."
    Martha "I apologized to him, but said I couldn't. I told him that I couldn't show anyone my work."
    Martha "His response was painful 'Then aren't you not really an artist?'"
    Martha "'Art isn't complete until someone else sees it, don't you think? What is the worst that could happen, by showing it to someone'"
    Martha annoyed "He couldn't understand.... He couldn't get it....."
    Martha "I can't... I just can't....."
    Martha "I.... can't........."
