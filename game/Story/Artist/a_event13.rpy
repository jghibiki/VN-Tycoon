    Martha annoyed "Nothing my conversation partner seemed to say to me stuck. I was just lost in a sea of depresion."
    Martha "I felt like I was stuck in quicksand, no matter what I did I couldn't escape."
    Martha "I began looking at everyone else's work. It seemd so much better than mine. Mine just lacked something... something that I couldn't understand... Something I probably would never be able to..."
    Martha sad "How do they do it?"
    Martha "How do they keep progressing?"
    Martha "I just don't understand."
    Martha "How can they keep moving forward?"
    Martha "I just don't get it..."
    Martha "What do they have... that I don't...?"
    
    Martha annoyed "They have this kind of drive... They constantly strive to do well, spending all their day sometimes. While I'm just me... I don't go that far... How.... do I become like them? How do I get drive?"
    Martha "How do I get it...? I don't understand.... I want it so bad. I want to succeed.... How... please someone tell me...?"
    Marthas "'I want to see your art.'"
    Martha "I read the request again."
    Martha "I don't know.... I just don't know..."
    Martha "And I retreated back to the paradise of covers."

    "It seems this story is not yet finished..."
    "Well this is embarsassing..."
    "A highly trained team of robotic monkeys is working to resolve this situation, if you see one give them this ticket number ASDHasdgghtq9g-0skot-q573n-fs4th-ortjpka-sg."
    "Or you can just check the updates in the coming days."
